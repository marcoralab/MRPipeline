TraitName: Trigliceryids
TraitBlurb: "***Trigliceryids*** [Willer et al Nat Genet 2013](https://www.nature.com/articles/ng.2797):
  To identify new loci and refine known loci influencing these lipids, we examined
  188,577 individuals using genome-wide and custom genotyping arrays. We identify
  and annotate 157 loci associated with lipid levels at P < 5 × 10−8, including
  62 loci not previously associated with lipid levels in humans."
